# IOT-BBMS_Hardware-
Node Micro-Controller Unit (NodeMCU) Wi-Fi-Based Controller Board is an open source platform for IoT applications and is used as the main microcontroller in this project. It is used to gather data read by the sensors and uploads these data to the firebase server. It also receives commands given by the user to perform specific tasks via the firebase server. NodeMCU consists of physical programmable circuit board similar to that of any other development boards, such as Arduino board and Raspberry Pi.
